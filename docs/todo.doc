Things that WILL be done for the next version
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- With multiball the skull kills ball leaving debris!
- Make the eyes that blink a block of some kind.
- blocks that come and go that are solid.
- one way blocks.
- speedup zones for ball
- make nowalls toggle on/off
- invisible blocks that flash every now and then and also when hit. - maybe
- Automatically adjust paddle pos when reverse is turn on and off. Sort of done.
- Sometimes all blocks are gone but it waits.
- Start Maintenance manual. Ah, Software Engineering for a game??
- Is bomb good or bad for players?
- Merge a lot of the pixmaps into one or two larger ones and extract the data
  from within it. This is better for performance with the X Server.
- Have a block that when hit jumps you some x levels ahead.
- use first button to fire 1 bullet and second to fire 2 bullets.


Things that MAY be done in the future
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- a paddle that splits into two.
- warp holes in walls.
- blocks that attract the ball ie: gravity.
- use floats for the dx and dy of the ball.
- A motd file that can be added.
- In no walls mode also wrap paddle around screen.
- Change the shape of the paddle to be convex.
- Some people may have a problem with the strftime() function call! Arggh
- Place all sounds in memory in array when used.
  suggested by Xyvind Yrke <oyvind@stavanger.sgp.slb.com>
- Also change the code so the paddle can be on top of screen too.!!
- Gravity bricks that pull the ball toward them.
- Areas of gravity fields that effect the ball.
- Have a best attempt today score.


Things that would be NICE but hard to do!
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Make multi-player with a paddle at each end of playfield. Long way off!
- Greyscale version or b&w - ages or soonish. Depends. I would have to redesign 
  a lot of the game and take out a lot of features.
- Have blocks that drop onto paddle and give you different things. - very hard!

Known Bugs
""""""""""

- Small cut away on some bricks when bouncing off them.
- Ball can still get stuck in an infinite loop on two solid walls and may 
  sometimes zoom straight up one wall on the left or right.
- Uses too much memory in the X Server for some people. he he
- Paddle gets stuck on one side of the wall sometimes.
- As I use a frame counter and it is a long int it will eventually run out
  one day and wrap around. If this happens then the game will become unstable
  as the animation routines will be waiting for a long time for the next frame
  unless they wrap as well!! I think.
